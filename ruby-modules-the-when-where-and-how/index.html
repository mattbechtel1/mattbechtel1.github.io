        <h4>Class v. Module</h4>
        <p>
          As nascent Rubyists begin to build simple and moderately-complex object-oriented applications, clarity on the
          purpose, usefulness, and features of Classes solidifies quickly. Not only are Classes at the very center of
          object-oriented programming, they are flexible enough that they could contain additional program code and
          methods that does not necessarily have to be directly related to the class or instances said Class was
          designed around.
        </p>

        <p>
          The same cannot be said of Modules, although most beginners will at least have some familiarity with modules
          even if they have not identified certain Module methods as being Module-based.
        </p>

        <img class="sideimage" src="../images/ruby-class-module-doc.png" alt="Ruby's documentation isn't helpful"
          style="float: left;" />
        <p>
          Adding to the confusion is that Ruby's documentation itself does not bother to clearly separate modules from
          classes. Where does Ruby list its top open modules? Intermixed in its list of shared classes, of course!
        </p>

        <p>
          But that word, 'intermixed', is the key to understanding the relationships between modules and classes.
          Whereas classes
          can certainly share their methods with each other through inheritance, Ruby's single inheritance
          constraint&mdash;that
          classes can only have <em>one</em> direct parent&mdash;limits how methods can be shared across different
          classes. That's where
          modules come in.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few of those open modules, however, are useful to even the beginning Rubyist. The <a
            href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/Enumerable.html" target="_blank">enumerables module</a> provides a ton
          of instance methods that are useful for transforming data arranged in arrays and lists.
          The <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Comparable.html" target="_blank">Comparable module</a> contains
          mixins that extend
          our comparative capabilities beyond simple less than, greater than, and equal to. And the <a
            href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Math.html">
            Math module</a> contains mathematical constants, like Pi, and some operations based on mathematical theory
          such as sin or square roots.
          Those operations are housed in class methods, so they would be called directly on the module (i.e.
          Math.sqrt(4) #=> 2.0).
        </p>


        <h4>Defining 'Module'</h4>

        <p>
          Stepping away from the idea of a class for a moment, we should define module alone. At its most basic a Ruby
          module is a <strong>collection of constants and methods</strong>. A module is simply a library where constants
          and methods reside. These constants and methods can then be used within a program's defined classes through
          the concept of a 'mixin'.
        </p>

        <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/3ohjUUxm1IFswwRDY4" width="480" height="480" frameBorder="0"
          class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
        <p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cheddar-food-magic-3ohjUUxm1IFswwRDY4">via GIPHY</a></p>

        <p>
          The inherent limitation of a module is its inability to create an instance of itself. As we'll see below,
          module methods can still be utilized as instance methods when mixed in with a class. But by staying away from
          instance-generating capabilities, modules are a little more reliable and stagnant, which make them great for
          storing constants and housing methods that would need to be accessed by different models in an app, such as
          methods that encrypt passwords or methods that conduct similar operations across different models within the
          same app.
        </p>


        <h4>Prepend, Include, and Extend</h4>

        <p>There are keywords that allow us to mix a module's methods into a class. They are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Extend</li>
          <li>Prepend</li>
          <li>Include</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When we <strong>extend</strong> a module into a class, its methods will become class methods.</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang=rb">
  <code>
  module MyModule
     def clarity
         "This code is in the clarity method of MyModule"
      end
  end
  
  class MyClass
      prepend MyModule
  
      def initialize(name)
          @name = name
      end
  
      def clarity
          "This code is in the clarity instance method of MyClass"
      end
  end
  
  instance1 = MyClass.new(instance1)
  
  MyClass.clarity # => 'This code is in the clarity method of MyModule'
  instance1.clarity # => 'This code is in the clarity instance method of MyClass'
  MyClass.ancestors.first # => MyClass
  </code>
  </pre>

        <p>
          We see that, using the 'extend' keyword to introduce our Class to our Module, methods defined within our
          module become class methods in our class. Our instance methods remain unchanged. MyClass is listed as first in
          MyClass's ancestor list, as would be expected of most classes with no inheritance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next up: <strong>prepend</strong>
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang=rb">
  <code>
  module MyModule
      def clarity
          "This code is in the clarity method of MyModule"
      end
  end
  
  class MyClass
      prepend MyModule
  
      def initialize(name)
          @name = name
      end
  
      def clarity
          "this code is in the clarity instance method of MyClass"
      end
  end
  
  instance1 = MyClass.new(instance1)
  
  MyClass.clarity # => undefined method `clarity' for MyClass:Class
  instance1.clarity # => this code is in the clarity method of MyClass
  MyClass.ancestors.first(2) # => [MyModule, MyClass]
  </code></pre>
        <p>
          With the 'prepend' keyword, our module shares its methods as instance classes and overwrites any instance
          classes already located in our class. This is quite different from a class inheritance structure, where a
          method of a parent class would not overwrite the method in a child class. Our module is able to do this by
          forcing itself to position one in the ancestors list, even before the name of the class it was called upon!
        </p>

        <p>
          And finally we come to <strong>including</strong> a module in a class.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang=rb">
<code>
module MyModule
    def clarity
        "This code is in the clarity method of MyModule"
    end
 
    def num
        @num
    end

    def add_one
        self.num + 1
    end   
end

class MyClass
    include MyModule

    def initialize(num)
        @num = num
    end


    def clarity
        "this code is in the clarity instance method of MyClass"
    end
end

instance1 = MyClass.new(1)

MyClass.clarity # => undefined method `clarity' for MyClass:Class
instance1.clarity => this code is in the clarity instance method of MyClass
instance1.add_one => 2
MyClass.ancestors.first => MyClass
</code></pre>

        <p>
          Again, calling our modules method as a class method results in a no method error, and, unlike with 'prepend',
          by using the 'include' keyword, our class's instance methods have priority over those in the module. However,
          we are able to call other module-based methods on our instances and can even use instance variables specific
          to our class within those methods. We can even house our getter and setter methods within the module.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because Ruby goes up the family tree to find relevant instance methods when they are called, this is key to
          determining when to include a module verses when to prepend a module with a class. Extend is used for class
          methods only.
        </p>

        <h4>When Should We Incorporate Modules?</h4>

        <p>
          Moving beyond the obvious answer that we use modules such as Enumerables and Math on a day-to-day basis and
          that various standard support products such as ActiveRecord are themselves modules, modules should probably be
          used fairly sparingly in simple applications. While modules have the ability to DRY out code, mixing too many
          modules into classes for a small set of methods can add too much abstraction.
        </p>

        <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/gOPWeWB9fuxm8" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed"
          allowFullScreen></iframe>
        <p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/weekend-dc-bets-gOPWeWB9fuxm8">via GIPHY</a></p>

        <p>
          Is there a hint that we should be using a module rather than placing methods in classes? If code appears to be
          repetitive across our classes, then placing methods in a module could probably take their place. Another
          situation is if we have a set of methods that are not obviously related to a single class but have some kind
          of commonality (such as all our math functions), they probably belong in a module.
        </p>
