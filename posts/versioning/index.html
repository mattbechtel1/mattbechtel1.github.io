        <h4>Why Do We Declare Versions for Our Apps?</h4>
        
        <p>
            You have just built a stable version of your app. You are incredibly proud of your work, you have deployed to a cloud platform, and intend to continue to develop it. It has been your intention the entire time to continuously integrate and continously develop the app.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually, you are going to push more and better code up to your host. Maybe you have  open-sourced your project, and other developers have taken an interest in your project and are contributing to the codebase. It is time to start declaring versions for your app, if you have not already. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The general authority on software versioning is <a href='https://semver.org/' target='_blank'>Semantic Versioning</a>. For a more in depth guide, please visit their website.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please note that adding a version number to your app is not an acceptable replacement for a high-quality readme file or API documentation. An update of your version number should take place <em>alongside</em> updates to readmes and other documentation.
        </p>


        <h4>What Do the Three Digits in a Version Mean?</h4>

        <p>
            Semantic versioning uses a decimal structure of 0.0.1. The first number indicates the MAJOR version release; the second number (between the decimals) indicates the MINOR version release; and the third number indicates PATCHES on the version.
        </p>

        <p>
            A MAJOR version is incompatible with previous released versions. The major version number should be incremented when a release's API is incompatible with previous released versions of the software. Essentially, any software that is dependent on your API will probably have to update their package dependencies. An <a href='https://semver.org/#spec-item-4' target='_blank'>exception</a> is if the software is on major version 0. Versions beginning with 0 are not consider stable and may regularly deploy incompatible code.
        </p>

        <p>
            A MINOR version may have substantial feature changes and improvements, but all improvements are backwards compatible for people accessing your software. Updates with feature deprecation also require a minor version release. Best practice is to include any feature deprecation in a minor version update even before a major version update, as it will give dependent developers and applications time to smoothly transition to your API update.
        </p>

        <p>
            A PATCH version is a release with only minor feature tweaks, front-end or code styling updates that do not change any routing, bumping your own app's dependancies, so long as those patches do not change the API
        </p>

        <h4>Optimization #2: Only Map State To Props When Absolutely Necessary</h4>
        
        <p>
            Using state store management allows us to have entire components that need not view state. Static pages, like <a href='https://succotash-app.herokuapp.com/guide'>Succotash's how-to page</a>, are perfect examples of fairly large scale components that do not need to read from the store.
        </p>

          <p>
            The images on that page are another matter. For the feature that magnifies images when you click them, I needed to dispatch an action to the reducer that mounted the <a href='https://material-ui.com/components/dialogs/#dialog'>Material-UI dialog box</a> that held the larger image. Material's React dialog boxes take in a prop 'open', that, when true, mounts to the page. What I found when I passed my prop from state to the component (and also when I closed the dialog box) was that all the images on the page would go through a reload because of the updated prop received from the store.
          </p>

          <p>
              The solution was to move the dialog box component down a level, so that the component holding the clickable image could take in no props from state. A new component was then nested inside the how-to page's image component, only passing the image URL as a prop. That inner component then held the dialog box, which was mapped directly to state.
          </p>

          <p>
              While in many cases, such a re-render would be barely noticeable, images are extremely obvious when they need to re-render, so this trick can help manage components, as well as abbreviate some of your components' codebase.
          </p>

         
      <h4>Optimization #3: Use Different Progress Loaders for Different Components</h4>

      <p>
          While it would be great for only a few select components to need state mapped to their props, in most apps, this is just not the case. And when props update with a connection to the backend, we need to use loaders to avoid some really buggy user experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
          The lazy solution is to put one reducer on the very top of the app, and load it at each fetch and unmount it once our promises resolve and our state updates. You could, of course, use tip #2 here to avoid extra renders. (Place a full-page loader in its own mini-component, but set it with full-page and z-index of -1 styling attributes.)
      </p>

      <p>
        For a slow-processing backend, however, this might be a little problematic from a UX perspective. Blocking an entire app for the sake of one component or unit is not an ideal set-up. The solution is to place a loader over just the component, rather than the entire page.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Succotash, this solution is implemented in the deadline list component, visible on both the profile view and the field view. Replacing the entire component with a circular loader would result in a very jerky motion of the visible component when our backend is operating at ideal speeds, so that is an awful solution. Instead, I used a wrapper div with relative positioning for the component's root returned node and the circular progress component as one of its children. The CSS looks something like:
      </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  <code>
  /* class for div that is the root node of your container component */
.wrapper {
  position: relative
}

 /* class for the backdrop that contains your loader, usually a direct child of the wrapper above */
.backdrop {
  z-index: -1,
  color: #fff,
  position: absolute
}
  </code>
</pre>

  <p>
    As opposed to using a bumpy ternary expression to choose between two different components, this method allows us to keep both the progress and full existing list on the screen until whatever backend edit (either a new deadline, removed deadline, or edited deadline) is completed.
  </p>

  <p>
    As far as rendering counts, props will change only twice for your wrapper component on an edit if you have set up your redux store and actions correctly. Once to bring the loader up, and once to both take the loader down and send the updated list through. Meanwhile, the rest of your app is still accessible and not hidden behind a dimmer and loader.
  </p>
