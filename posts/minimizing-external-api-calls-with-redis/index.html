        <h4>API Call Expenses</h4>
        <p>
            With the amount of public and pseudo-public APIs out in the world today, there is no shortage of databases for you and other developers to use to develop your own application. And the API providers know this too. Very few of the most popular APIs allow everyone and anyone to hit their databases at will.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the time, a developer will be issued a unique API key to send along as a header in their requests. The public API developer then has quite a few options to limit your access. They may set a daily or monthly limit on your API. If they are really creative, they could throttle your requests to spread out services. And, of course, they could take your credit card information and charge you a rate for each request.  No matter which limitation option the API developer chooses, you have an interest in limiting your requests to their API.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are also the other expenses of an API call: time and allocations. If we can avoid making superfluous calls to the external API, our app will inevitably run faster as we will cut out the request-response cycle. We will tax our server less, and deliver data to our frontend views faster.
        </p>

        <p>
            Caching is the obvious solution here. If we can store previous data responses from the external API on our own server, we can access them when people call on our views or API. In this blog, I will provide an example of this simple coding pattern using a Rails controller file running alongside a Redis server.
        </p>

        <h4>Setting Up Redis Locally</h4>

        <p>
            Before you can get started with caching, you will need to set up Redis on your machine. If you have not already, download the latest stable version of Redis from the project's <a href='https://redis.io/download' target='_blank'>downloads page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should now have access to the command line commands `redis-server` and `redis-cli`, which will boot the Redis server and allow you to edit data through the command line respectively. Play around with it a bit to make sure it is working. If you are having difficulty, check out the <a href='https://redis.io/topics/quickstart'>quickstart documentation</a> provided by Redis.
        </p>

        <p>
            I assume here that we have already run `rails new` and created a simple object-oriented application. With Redis installed, we now have to integrate it into our development environment in Rails. We need to tell Rails that we will a) be using a cache store and b) Redis will be our cache store. In order to tell Rails that a cache store, we need to create a temporary file, for which we have a few simple command line options:
        </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
<code>touch tmp/caching-dev.txt</code>
</pre>

        <p>
            or:
        </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
<code>rails dev:cache</code>
</pre>

        <p>
            Running the command `rails dev:cache` a second time will toggle caching off and remove the temp file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that Rails knows we intend to cache data, we need to set it up to use Redis. In our development environment file, we need to change a variable. In the caching section, our environment file should include:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/mattbechtel1/57e506ecbf6ab9237c6eb8133888810e.js"></script>

        <p>
            Most of this snippet is already provided, but we want to change our cache_store option to `:redis_cache_store`. I also changed the maximum age of the cache to 365 days, but you can choose what every you would like when setting up your store. If you provide that field with an integer, it will assume you are providing the number of seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            We also need to add a few gems to our gemfile to get Redis working. Our gemfile should now include:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/mattbechtel1/02e869bfd0401d68753a4609c545201a.js"></script>

        <p>
            Lastly, we need to initialize an instance of Redis for our application. There are a number of syntax options, including using a global variable or not initializing at all and just calling `Rails.cache.redis` every time you need to access the Redis cache. I, however, prefer to create a new initializer file:
          </p>
          
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/mattbechtel1/4cb6e6e6f73b5747ba8f1783f107ee7e.js"></script>
          
          <p>
            <em>I use the <a href='https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro'>Figaro</a> gem to store environment variables in my projects and therefore use a application.yml file, but there are other, more common, Rails-centric ways to store environment variables.</em>
          </p>

        <p>
            The password option should only be included if you set a password to access your Redis server (requirepass myRedisPassword). You can also pass it through at the end of your initializer file with Redis.current.auth(ENV["REDIS_PASSWORD"])
        </p>

        <p>
            And lastly, we will need to run `redis-server` from our command line to boot up our server.
        </p>

        <p>
            With our cache store set up for use in Rails and Redis running, we are ready to manipulate our controller files to minimize our API calls.
        </p>

        <h4>Dr. Redis</h4>
        <h5>or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the JSON</h5>

        <p>
            I first implemented this caching pattern in an API on a transit app I created using <a href='https://developer.wmata.com/' target='_blank'>WMATA's public API</a>. In the age of Covid-19, it is not getting too much use at the moment, but WMATA does keep track of how many calls are made to their API endpoints. The default (free) tier is limited to 10 calls per second and 50,000 calls per day. If we ever start using public transit regularly again and my app becomes popular, I need to limit the number of calls to their endpoints. Redis allows me to cut the number of calls significantly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our strategy is to cache responses on the first call and set the length of time the data will survive in our cache. My full transit app has <a href='https://github.com/mattbechtel1/Metrobus2020/blob/master/backend/config/routes.rb' target='_blank'>seven different routes</a> that each connect (through a controller) to a unique endpoint of WMATA's API. And each of those endpoints has different considerations for how long we need to cache their response. For the endpoint that provide bus prediction data, we probably only want to cache the data for less than a minute, since that data will quickly become stale. For the endpoint that delivers us a list of different rail line names, we could keep that data fresh until the Purple line opens in late 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
          I will use the API fetch to the list of bus routes as the first example. WMATA makes changes to their bus route list a little more often than the train lines list, so we probably want to make sure we get this data at least once per week. In our controller:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/mattbechtel1/6cba0ca9da6e5df9a900faacb4c5f0fa.js"></script>

        <p>
          So, first we check to see if Redis has already stored data associated with our key ('allBuses'). If not, we complete the API call as normal, which returns a JSON object. We then set the JSON object as the value for our 'allBuses' key and set an expiration time of one week (604,800 seconds).
        </p>

        <p>
          Redis defaults to storing string values, but it can also manage to store hashes, lists, and sets with just <a href='https://redis.io/commands/hset' target='_blank'>a slightly different command</a>. It may be tempting to store a hash or list in Redis, then. But let's take a moment to consider what that would require our controller to do. First we would need to parse our JSON object and convert it into an array. Then we would need to iterate through that array of bus routes, create something (an integer?) to use as a secondary-key, that will point to another series of key-value pairs that hold the data fields we got back for each bus route. That's awfully complicated. Key-value databases like Redis are not practical for storing deeply nested hashes and arrays. Plus, our entire goal with using a cache is to save time on our subsequent calls. Adding the time complexity of loops to pack or unpack our Redis hash and parse or construct our JSON objects is going to cut deeply into, if not completely undo, whatever time we saved with our cache store.
        </p>

        <p>
          But... what does Ruby think that JSON response is exactly? A string! We don't need to convert our JSON into anything Ruby can iterate over. That's our single-page frontend's (or Rails view's) problem. In Redis and Rails, we can just store the gigantic, ugly JSON string as the value for the 'allBuses' key.
        </p>

        <p>
          What kind of time does this save? Let's call the bus_route_list method twice and find out.
        </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
<code>
# call method with Redis key not yet existing
  Processing by MetroController#bus_route_list as */*
  Completed 200 OK in 150ms (Views: 0.2ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms | Allocations: 1288)

# call method again finding the Redis key and returning the cached data
  Processing by MetroController#bus_route_list as */*
  Completed 200 OK in 2ms (Views: 0.1ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms | Allocations: 145)
</code>
</pre>

        <p>
          We went from 150ms to get a 200 response down to just 2ms, and from 1288 memory allocations to just 145! We have saved fairly significant time and space with our cache in addition to saving towards our monthly API call limit.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bus_route_list method is similar to an index method in a more RESTful Rails APi controller. When sending along a parameter, we can just store that parameter as part of the key. In the same controller class, we can call the WMATA API endpoint that provides us a list of upcoming bus arrivals when provided with a bus stop's id:
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/mattbechtel1/695524388b37935e979bc5b75f7a2ec9.js"></script>

        <p>
           By using the parameter for the bus stop ID as part of the key, we can store potentially as many as keys as WMATA has unique bus stops.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of how frequently the WMATA API updates bus arrivals, we set the key-value pair to expire after only 20 seconds. While the expiration time was used in both examples above, it is not required that we use this option. If we do not set an expiration time limit, the key will not expire until either a) Redis runs out of space and your <a href='https://redis.io/topics/lru-cache'>eviction policy</a> removes the key or b) you manually delete it.
        </p>
